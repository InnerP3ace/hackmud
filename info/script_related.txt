Color can be applied to text by wrapping it in certain symbols.
This works with letters, numbers and underscores (the standard "word" characters in many languages).
All currently-known text colors are shown below.

`0zero`
`1one`
`2two`
`3three`
`4four`
`5five`
-minus-
+plus+
!bang!

regex can take into account the color of the text you are going for. if the text you want is colored, you have to wrap the capture group with `.(\w+)`
